# obliques
Sends an SMS with one of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies in it.
By default, it sends an SMS at a random time between 10:00 and 20:00 system time, but you can do it however you like.

### TODO:
- remove dependence on midnight cron job
- allow multiple recipients
- make time randomisation smarter
